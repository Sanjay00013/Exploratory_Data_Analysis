# 📊 United Nations Global Terrorism Analysis (UNGTA) Dataset Project

## 🏆 Project Overview
The **United Nations Global Terrorism Analysis (UNGTA) dataset** provides a comprehensive repository of **terrorist incidents recorded from 1970 to 2017**. With over **180,000 incidents**, this dataset offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of terrorism across the globe. This project aims to **explore, analyze, and visualize** the data to uncover patterns and trends related to terrorist activities.

Through this analysis, the primary objective is to:
- Identify **temporal and spatial trends** in terrorism.
- Understand **attack methods, target types, and casualty distribution**.
- Examine correlations between different variables.
- Provide **actionable insights** for security and policy-making efforts.

## 🔥 Key Features of the Dataset
- **Event Specifics**: Detailed records of terrorist attacks, including **date, location, and nature of the incident** (e.g., assassination, bombing, hostage-taking).
- **Geographic and Demographic Information**: Insights into affected regions, including **country, region, and city specifics**, as well as details about **targeted groups or individuals**.
- **Attack Details**: Information on **attack methods, weapons used, and type of attack** (e.g., explosive, incendiary, or armed assault).
- **Impact Assessment**: Data on **casualties**, including the number of **killed or wounded**, and any **property damage or ransom demands** associated with the attacks.

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings
- **Temporal Trends**: The highest number of terrorist attacks occurred in **2014**, with a sharp increase after **2010**.
- **Most Affected Countries**: **Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and Colombia** witnessed the highest number of attacks.
- **Regional Impact**: The **Middle East and Africa** had the most fatalities from terrorism.
- **India’s Situation**: Terrorist activities increased significantly post-2010, peaking in **2016**. The **CPI-Maoist** group was the most active in India.
- **Top Terrorist Groups**: The most prominent groups include **Taliban, ISIL (Islamic State), and Unknown Groups**.
- **Common Attack Types**: The majority of attacks involved **bombings/explosions**, followed by **armed assaults**.
- **Suicide Attacks**: Around **97%** of attacks were **suicide-based**.
- **Success Rate**: **89% of terrorist attacks** were successful, while 11% failed.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Techniques**
- **Visualization & Statistical Analysis**

## 📢 Key Recommendations for Law Enforcement & Government
### 🔹 Focus on High-Risk Regions
- Prioritize security measures in **regions with frequent terrorist activities**.
- Strengthen **border security and intelligence-sharing mechanisms**.
